__Robot vs Robot__

The goal of this project is to create an environement for battles between robots.
It's inspired by robocode and code combat.

_What's now_
Actually, the program is just at its beginning, and many things have to be done before it become usable.
The UI don't permit to make things correctly and should be one of the next step. It's already possible to create robots directly in the Robots package, and to call them by modifying the code in RvRUI/UI.java. After, I think to dynamically call the robots' code to implement it without recompile the whole thing. You can't create wall now, but you can create some LootEntities like the HealthEntity.
